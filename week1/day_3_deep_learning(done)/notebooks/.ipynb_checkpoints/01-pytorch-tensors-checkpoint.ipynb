    "In this notebook you'll get introduced to [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), a framework for building and training neural networks. Specifically, today we'll explore operations that can be applied to tensors using this framework. Understanding how tensors work is essential for both building, training and inspecting different aspects of a neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you'll see, PyTorch, in a lot of ways behaves like the arrays you may love from Numpy. These Numpy arrays, after all, are just tensors. PyTorch takes these tensors and makes it simple to move them to GPUs for the faster processing needed when training neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The PyTorch framework main characteristics are:\n",
    " - a thin framework over python that inherits its core from its Lua predecessor called Torch\n",
    " - dynamically generates neural network computational graphs\n",
    " - it's object oriented with powerful debugging support\n",
    "\n",
    "which adhere to a development philosophy that promotes linear code-flow, integrates full inter-operability with Python ecosystem and is \\item.\n"

Recall that a vector is a 1-dimensional tensor, a matrix is a 2-dimensional tensor, an array with three indices is a 3-dimensional tensor (RGB color images for example). The fundamental data structure for neural networks are tensors and PyTorch (as well as pretty much every other deep learning framework) is built around tensors.\n",
